I have studied 5 Courses during 3rd Semester of engineering offered by Department of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, VPKBIET Baramati . 

Also implemented Laboratory Assignments of the same .
# 210241-Discrete Mathematics 
-  Set theory , types of set and propositional logic .
-  Relation which consist of finding closure , equivivalence , partial ordering .
-  Function and its types .   
-  Counting Principles  like Permutation and Combination .
-  Graph Theory consisting of Eulers Theorem , Hamiltonian Circuit, Dijkstras Algorithm , Planar Graphs , Graph Colouring .   
-  Trees like Minimum spanning tree , Kruskal and Prims Algorithm Transport flow network .
